# OIL-MARKET-STRUCTURE

This is data used for research titled "The impacts of crude oil market structure on stock trading market: evidence from asian countries".

The study examines the impact of crude oil market structure on stock markets in Asian countries in the period 2008-2017. To achieve the research objective, we integrate network analysis with the SGMM estimation technique. Network analysis was conducted with 43 Asian countries, while analysis of the impact of crude oil market structure on stock markets was performed with a sample of 19 countries. The results show that the stock market has a positive growth in countries with stronger export capacity while it is negatively affected in larger importing countries. In addition, the research results show that the growth of the stock market is greater in countries with a central position in the crude oil market.
